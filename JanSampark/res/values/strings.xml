    <string name="info">About Us &#8211; Swaraj &#8211; In olden days, kings toured their kingdoms to check the well-being of civilians and make sure that there is no disconnect between the information received from his darbar members and the civilian. Analogous to the historic kingdoms is a vast empire today, a country of 120 crore divided into states and in turn constituencies, a total of 4200 with each housing between 1.5&#8211;2 lakh grown up and responsible citizens working day and night to build their future for the country. What they want in turn is to get their day-to-day problems heard and resolved efficiently by the governing bodies of the nation.\n\n\nIn a modern day set up, a disconnect between the citizens and their representatives, information gap and the inability to handle massive feedbacks has led to a poor unresponsive governance. Swaraj is an initiative to bridge this gap and empower citizens to strengthen local leadership. It helps you to raise your problems within seconds and we will make sure they are heard and acted upon.\n\n\nAll that needs to be done is to choose the issue category, select the issue from a predefined list and tap a button to post the issue from your current location received via GPS. Now, isn’t that simple! So, if you have problem in your locality, what are you waiting for?</string>
